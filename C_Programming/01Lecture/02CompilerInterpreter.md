# Compiler and Interpreter 

# Compiler

>    A compiler is a software that converts the source code to the object code. 
>    In other words, we can say that it converts the high-level language to machine/binary language. 
>    Moreover, it is necessary to perform this step to make the program executable. 
>    This is because the computer understands only binary language.


# Interpreter

>     In computer science, an interpreter is a computer program that directly executes instructions 
>    written in a programming or scripting language, without requiring them previously to have been 
>    compiled into a machine language program.
