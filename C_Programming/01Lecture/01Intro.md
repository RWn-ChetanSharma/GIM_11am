# C Language Introduction

> C is a procedural programming language.  
> Initially developed by Dennis Ritchie in the year 1972 at Bell Laboratories of AT&T Labs. 
> It was mainly developed as a system programming language to write the UNIX operating system.


# The main features of the C language include:

> General Purpose and Portable
> Low-level Memory Access
> Fast Speed
> Clean Syntax

# Why Should We Learn C?

> Many later languages have borrowed syntax/features directly or indirectly from the C language. 
> Like syntax of Java, PHP, JavaScript, and many other languages are mainly based on the C language. 
> C++ is nearly a superset of C language (Only a few programs may compile in C, but not in C++).

> So,  if a person learns C programming first, it will help him to learn any modern programming language as well. 
> As learning C help to understand a lot of the underlying architecture of the operating system. 
> Like pointers, working with memory locations, etc.


# History of C language 

> The C programming language was developed in the Bell Labs of AT&T by an employee called Dennis Ritchie 
> between 1969 and 1973 while working on Unix operating system.

> He created this language using ALGOL, BCPL, and B the languages that were used before C was created.
