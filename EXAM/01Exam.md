>Total Marks: 50

# Problem 1: Basic Data Types and Variables (10 Marks)

> Write a C program that performs the following tasks:

1. Declare variables of different data types (int, float, double, char) and initialize 
    them with appropriate values.
2. Print the value of each variable along with its data type.
3. Demonstrate the use of constants by defining some constants and using them 
    in expressions.
4. Show how the size of different data types can be displayed using sizeof().

 # Example Output:

    Integer: 10
    Float: 20.5
    Double: 30.555
    Character: A    
    Size of int: 4 bytes
    Size of float: 4 bytes
    Size of double: 8 bytes
    Size of char: 1 byte


# Problem 2: Operators and Expressions (10 Marks)

 > Write a C program that performs the following tasks:

1. Declare two variables, a and b, and initialize them with integer values.
2. Use arithmetic operators to compute and display the sum, difference, product, 
   and quotient of a and b.
3. Use relational operators to compare a and b and display the result of each comparison.
4. Use logical operators to check if both a and b are positive numbers and display 
    the result.

 # Example Output:

    Sum: 15
    Difference: 5
    Product: 50
    Quotient: 2
    a > b: 1 (true)
    a < b: 0 (false)
    Both a and b are positive: 1 (true)


# Problem 3: Control Structures (10 Marks)

> Write a C program that does the following:

1. Prompt the user to enter an integer value.
2. Use an if-else statement to check if the entered number is positive, negative, or 
    zero and print the appropriate message.
3. Use a switch statement to display a message based on a number entered by the user 
    (e.g., 1 for "Monday", 2 for "Tuesday", etc., up to 7 for "Sunday").


    # Example Output:

    Enter a number: -5
    The number is negative.

    Enter a number (1-7): 3
    Wednesday

# Problem 4: Looping (10 Marks)

> Write a C program that performs the following tasks:

1. Use a for loop to print the first 10 natural numbers.
2. Use a while loop to calculate and print the factorial of a number provided by the user.
3. Use a do-while loop to print a menu repeatedly until the user chooses to exit. 
    The menu should have options like "1. Option 1", "2. Option 2", and "3. Exit".

    # Example Output:

    First 10 natural numbers:
    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

    Enter a number to calculate factorial: 5
    Factorial of 5 is 120

    Menu:
    1. Option 1
    2. Option 2
    3. Exit
    Enter your choice: 3
    Exiting...


# Problem 5: Combined Application (10 Marks)

> Write a C program that combines multiple concepts:

1. Prompt the user to enter a number (n) for the size of a table.
2. Use a for loop to generate a multiplication table for numbers from 1 to n.
3. Inside the loop, use a control structure to format the output properly.
4. Use constants for table size and formatting strings.

    # Example Output:


    Enter the size of the table: 5

    Multiplication Table:
    1 x 1 = 1
    1 x 2 = 2
    1 x 3 = 3
    1 x 4 = 4
    1 x 5 = 5
    ...



# Grading Criteria:

1. Correctness of the output and functionality (50%)
2. Proper use of data types, variables, constants, operators, and expressions (20%)
3. Proper use of control structures and looping constructs (20%)
4. Code clarity and documentation (10%)


# Make sure to thoroughly test your code and validate that it handles different inputs correctly. Good luck!
